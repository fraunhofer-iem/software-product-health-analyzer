## Stale issue and pull request policy

Issues and pull requests have a shelf life and sometimes they are no longer relevant. All issues and pull requests that
have not had any activity for 90 days will be marked as `stale`. Simply leave a comment with information about why it
may still be relevant to keep it open. If no activity occurs in the next 7 days, it will be automatically closed.

The goal of this process is to keep the list of open issues and pull requests focused on work that is actionable and
important for the maintainers and the community.
